# Probability

* Binomial Distribution Problem: `(n choose k) (P^K) (1-P)^(n-k)` 
  * I.e., You have `n` things, what is the probability you will choosing `k` of them in a specific state. 
* `P^k == Probability of k things being in that state`. 
* `(1-P)^(n-K) == probability of the remaining thigns being in not thatstate`.
* `(n choose k)` how many ways there are to choose `n` things out of `k`.
